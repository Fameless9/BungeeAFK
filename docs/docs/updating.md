# Updating BungeeAFK
BungeeAFK regularly receives updates. The plugin automatically checks for new updates once per day. If an update is available,
you will receive a notification in the console. To update, follow the same steps and in [installation steps](installation.md#installation-steps). After updating, some features
may require additional configuration. After starting the server, run `/bafk configuration saveconfig` to save the current configuration to the `config.yml` file.
This will also save all new configuration options that were added in the new version together with their default values and comments.
From there, you can adjust the settings as needed and run `/bafk configuration reloadconfig` to apply the changes without restarting the server
(See [Configuration](configuration.md) for more details).
