The plugin comes with a PlaceholderAPI expansion. Below is a list of available placeholders:

| Placeholder            | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `%bafk_user_afk%`      | Displays the afk state of a player `true` if AFK, `false` if not. |
| `%bafk_afk_users%`     | Displays a list of all AFK-players on the current server          |
| `%bafk_active_users%`  | Displays a list of all non-AFK players on the current server      |

To use these placeholders, ensure that you have PlaceholderAPI installed on your server.
You can then incorporate these placeholders into your chat formats, scoreboard displays, or any other compatible plugins that support PlaceholderAPI.
