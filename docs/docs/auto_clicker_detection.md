BungeeAFK supports auto-clicker detection to prevent players from using auto-clickers or similar tools to bypass AFK detection.
This feature is useful for maintaining fair gameplay and ensuring that players are genuinely active.

### Limitations
Auto-clicker detection is **disabled** by default and must be enabled manually, as false positives, while being unlikely, can still occur.
BungeeAFK cannot distinguish between a player holding down a button and an auto-clicker, as it is limited to monitoring player
interactions and not actual clicks. Therefore, if a player is holding down a button for long enough, it may trigger the auto-clicker detection system.
It is recommended to enable this feature only if you are aware of the potential for false positives and are willing to handle them.

### Configuring Auto-Clicker Detection
See [Configuring Auto-Clicker Detection](configuration.md#auto-clicker-detection-settings) for more information on how to configure the detection.
See also [Auto-Clicker Commands](commands.md#auto-clicker-detection-commands) for commands to interact with auto-clicker detection.

### How it works
BungeeAFK uses a system that is very proof against false positives, but can still detect auto-clickers and similar tools.
It works by monitoring the standard deviation of the time between player interactions over the last 150 interactions in each window.
If the standard deviation is below a certain threshold, it is assumed that the player is using an auto-clicker or similar tool.
This threshold can be configured in the `config.yml` file under the `auto-clicker` section.
The default threshold is `10ms`. Lower threshold = false positives are less likely, but it is more difficult to detect actual auto-clickers.

In order for the player to be flagged as using an auto-clicker, the threshold must be met in 3 windows of 150 interactions in a row.
This means that the player must be clicking very consistently for at least 450 interactions in a row to be flagged.
This is to prevent false positives from players who are just very (very) consistent at clicking.
If a player is flagged as using an auto-clicker, the action configured in the `config.yml` file under the `auto-clicker` section will be executed.
See [Configuring Auto-Clicker Detection](configuration.md#auto-clicker-detection-settings) for more information on how to configure the detection.
