BungeeAFK cannot distinguish between a player holding down a button and an auto-clicker, as it is limited to monitoring player interactions and not actual clicks. Therefore, if a player is holding down a button for long enough, it may trigger the auto-clicker detection system. It is recommended to enable this feature only if you are aware of the potential for false positives and are willing to handle them.</p>"},{"location":"auto_clicker_detection/#configuring-auto-clicker-detection","title":"Configuring Auto-Clicker Detection","text":"<p>See Configuring Auto-Clicker Detection for more information on how to configure the detection.

It works by monitoring the standard deviation of the time between player interactions over the last 150 interactions in each window. If the standard deviation is below a certain threshold, it is assumed that the player is using an auto-clicker or similar tool. This threshold can be configured in the <code>config.yml</code> file under the <code>auto-clicker</code> section. The default threshold is <code>10ms</code>. Lower threshold = false positives are less likely, but it is more difficult to detect actual auto-clickers.</p> <p>In order for the player to be flagged as using an auto-clicker, the threshold must be met in 3 windows of 150 interactions in a row. This means that the player must be clicking very consistently for at least 450 interactions in a row to be flagged. This is to prevent false positives from players who are just very (very) consistent at clicking. If a player is flagged as using an auto-clicker, the action configured in the <code>config.yml</code> file under the <code>auto-clicker</code> section will be executed. See Configuring Auto-Clicker Detection for more information on how to configure the detection.</p>"},{"location":"bypass_regions/","title":"Bypass Regions","text":"<p>BungeeAFK supports bypass-regions, allowing players to be AFK in specific regions without being detected as AFK by the plugin.
